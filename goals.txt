Problem we wish to address:
- EM problems are often very unintuitive due to them being hard to visualize fully.
- There are no good visual aids to really grasp the concepts we learn and problems we do

Over arching goal:
- Come up with various visualizations and plots for different problems in homework assignments we've had over the course of the two semesters
using Matplotlib
- Typically would use problems that can be solved numerically and result in a cool animation over time. Should add manipulation to parameters 
over time in order to accomplish this.
- Have 3 - 4 animations by the time we have final presentations.

Problem 7.22
- Show the plot of the EMF, Current, and Flux for both loops
- Show what happens as the separation between the two loops changes (show what happens if the small loop were to go through the big loop?)
- Animate these plots
- Animate the interaction with vector fields
- Use different functions for the separation between the two (sinusoidal, linear)
- Show the vector field along side the changing functions of current, flux, emf, etc.
